## 🧠 How It Works

**Data Conversion:** Product reviews from a CSV file are converted into searchable documents.

**Embeddings:** Text is transformed into vectors using HuggingFace models.

**Storage:** Vectors are stored in AstraDB for fast retrieval.

**RAG Pipeline:** LangChain connects the database with a Groq-powered chatbot that answers questions using relevant reviews.

**Session Memory:** Each user session keeps track of chat history for better context.
